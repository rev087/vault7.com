# Caché's Smoking Gun

![Opening Sequence](cache.00.01.png?raw=true)

In 2005, _Caché_, (distributed as _Hidden_ in a few countries) a film by Austrian director [Michael Haneke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Haneke) was released. Five years later, a [review by Roger Ebert](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100113/REVIEWS08/100119986/-1/) stirred much debate surrounding a supposed [_smoking gun_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_gun) the reviewer discovered in his third time watching the film:

> How is it possible to watch a thriller intently two times and completely miss a smoking gun that's in full view? Yet I did. Only on my third trip through Michael Haneke's "Cache" did I consciously observe a shot which forced me to redefine the film.  

If you haven't watched this masterpiece yet, I urge you: go watch it. Done? Good, because heavy spoilers follow.

After opening his review with this taunting mistery, Ebert proceeds with his usual notes without revealing what he found. He wraps it up with a hint tho:

> Now I call your attention to the shot I missed the first time through. You will find it on the DVD, centering around 20:39. You tell me what it means. It's the smoking gun, but did it shoot anybody?

The problem is that there are different versions of the DVD, so 20:39 points to different scenes. Still, it's generally accepted that Ebert is refering to the short memory/dream scene where a young boy is caught coughing up blood.

> I told Mom he was coughing up blood.   
&mdash; Georges

Exactly why this scene would be the glaring smoking gun that Roger Ebert refers to is still widely debated, but I have my own theory.

The generally accepted purpose of this scene is that it serves as a means to connect Georges and Majid's past to the drawings sent to Georges' home, a depiction of the lie he used to get his then recently adopted brother out of his life. A dream conjured by guilt, if you will. Guilt, by the way, is a focal point in the movie; if Georges feels it at all, he is quite convincing at hiding it - and for that he is reproached by Majid's son and arguably by his own wife.

A very similar memory/dream scene can be seen at around 13:39, in the middle of the facade shot where Georges parks his car then walks into the view, then inside his home:

Like the movie's opening scene, the facade shot is shown to us as Georges and his wife are watching it. The memory/dream scene then appears, supposedly as a repressed memory resurfacing in Georges' mind while watching the tape. The movie then cuts back to the facade shot, again with a dialogue between Georges and his wife in the background: she seems to notice Georges' distress, who dismisses her worry blaming tiredness, but proceeds to ask her to see the drawing again:

Some time later, Georges receives the tape where the "mysterious stalker" drives up to his childhood home. Georves flyes over to visit his aging mother, maybe out of concern for her safety. There he has a nightmare, where a young Majid is seen killing a rooster by cutting off it's head with an axe, getting glood spurs all over himself. While the decapitated bird jerks frantically on the floor, Majid - axe in hand - threateningly walks towards Georges and is about to land a strike before he wakes up from the dream.

The next tape reveals Majid's current address, and the following (re)encounter is the most pivotal point of the movie.

> &mdash; What wouldn't we do not to lose what's ours?  
> &mdash; You were older and stronger then me. I had no choice.

But what if that scene was to be interpreted as an actual memory from Georges' childhood? That would mean that he _did_ find Majid coughing blood

# DRAFT

- The memory/dream scenes in the movies are somewhat ambiguous; it's unclear wether they are to be interpreted literaly, as a flashback, or as a corrupted memory.
- Depending on the choice of interpretation, the whole plot can take an entirely different interpretation.
- Most commentators on the internet tend to interpret these scenes as merely the connection between Georges and Majid's past and the drawings sent to Georges' home.
- The focal point of the movie is the guilt that Georges should feel towards his actions against Majid as a child
